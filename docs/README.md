## Framework Overview

Zens is designed to be a flexible and powerful framework for creating and managing intelligent agent-based city simulations. The framework is built with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and customization of functionality.

### Core Features

- Agent Creation and Management
- Memory and Relationship Systems
- Dynamic Interactions
- Personality Generation
- Event Management

### Extensions

The framework can be extended with additional modules for enhanced functionality:

- Multi-City System: Create and manage multiple interconnected cities
- Economic System: Implement virtual economies with currencies and trade
- Internet Connectivity: Allow agents to interact with real-world data
- LLM Adapters: Support for multiple language models
